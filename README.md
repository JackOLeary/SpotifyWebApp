# SpotifyWebApp
This is a Spotify Data WebApp, that looks at account data and finds trends, it was created with React.JS using the following tutorial: https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app

I really enjoyed this tutorial, it gave me the first introduction to react and using hooks, as well as authentication with an api, storing variables in local storage and using styled components.
## To Run the Web App
npm install

npm start
